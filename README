Until I can get CodeBlocks compiling to finally work, here's a simple introduction to KalculatoR
Kalculator is a simple calculator, You can just do multipication, subtraction, division and adding.
It's lightweight, minimal and it is simple, which is something most small applications should do.
Wanna contribute to the project and add more calculating features? You can DM me in Discord:
